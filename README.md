# CS:GO AutoDemo
This tool will automatically record POV demos for you when you are ingame. 

It will save your demos to your `Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\autodemo` Directory.

## Anti-Virus warnings
To record POV demos this program has to access the csgo process, this is heuristically seen as a malicious by many anti virus programs, it is however a false positive in this case.

## VAC
This probably won't get you banned as it is doing nothing that would make it be considered a cheat.
